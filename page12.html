        <h1>Political</h1>
				
		<p>Populist appeals have proven to be an effective means of swaying public consciousness in support of fascistic governance. Private interests, particularly of those most affluent, have the proclivity to retain their wealth by circumventing taxation of their assets. Projecting into the future, the population who enjoys this status is likely to remain a small subset of the overall populace, forming a minority group. Yet, it is possible for this population to exert authority over the majority by appealing to attitudes indiscriminate of personal income status.  </p>
    <p>This can be achieved via rhetoric that appeals towards nativist sentiment. An assumption is made that this future version of the U.S. retains the defining features of a core country and, accordingly, is attractive to would-be expats. Poor economic conditions would create an efflux of population and render this approach null. Assuming there is no absolute homogeneity–that is, in cultural, economic, and social aspects–there would exist an outgroup and ingroup such that populist appeals can be exploited, and the outgroup can be marginalized in favor of the more expansive and influential ingroup.  </p>
    <p>In a doomsday scenario, a future U.S. would experience the deteriorization of pre-dominant political institutions, paving the path for which a rising political movement–perhaps fascist-leaning–to supersede it. On the contrary, an optimistic scenario, resembling the continuation of political processes and intact structure of the U.S. government, could permit the leveraging of political institutions to reinforce a fascist-like agenda. Therefore, we would observe a gradual decline in liberal democracy and freedoms unless it gives ignition to a radical social insurrection with mass-appeal. However, the former appears more likely to change to systems as robust as the modern government entail drastic change which may be unfeasible in the short-term.  </p>
