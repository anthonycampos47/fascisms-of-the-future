        <h1>A Future Fascism</h1>
				
		<p>A futuristic fascism would likely incorporate contemporary elements such as a centralized and militarized state and the severe limitation of personal freedoms. We can anticipate that technological advances would supplement this mode of governance. Mass surveillance systems could incorporate the use of autonomous technology such as some futuristic variant of drones to detect possible manifestations of opposition to the system. Artificial generative intelligence could incorporate biases favorable to the fascistic government by nature, as a means to reinforce its control as the predominant ideology. Pro-fascist propagandic messages could be displayed on technological devices owned by private citizens as a means to assert control of the populace. We can also theorize about a depletion of non-renewable and vital resources or a change in climate to a near inhospitable one.  Thus, a fascist government may wield control over the distribution of vital resources. It may also punish individuals deemed enemies of the state from receiving access to critical resources such as food and water. Fascism implies control and to some degree, stability, so it could possibly be viewed as a haven in the event there is catastrophic-level global harsh climate. However, we can expect rigid controls over what the populace can do and diversion from the pre-established system could entail severe consequences. However, in the ideological aspect, it may not differ from contemporary and historical modes of fascism as it would necessitate the integration of the elements that define it. A likely scenario, however, would be a transcending–a branching off– from fascism to an ideology that complements the environmental conditions of the futuristic period.  </p>

This enables a populist insurrection. </p>
