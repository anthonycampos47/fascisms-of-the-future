        <h1>Introduction</h1>
				
		<p>Current funding suggests the US will retain its position as a world power. A substantial monetary budget enables U.S.-engineered and produced military equipment to be significantly more advanced than what is produced by other nations. Further, this funding enables the U.S. to retain its global presence by means of its military bases sparsely spread throughout the world. Funding also goes towards preserving national security such as the national guard, which offers a semblance of stability. </p>
		<p>However, the issue lies within public opinion of the military, Contemporary dwindling enrollment in the military is indicative of a negative public perception. Of course, the government can rectify the issue by means of the Selective Service, but that comes at the risk of generating poor public opinion as it is unlikely that obligatory military service would be viewed upon favorably and the process could reveal inequities if exceptions are made.  </p>
		<p>A typical coup overthrow of the government appears unlikely as that would require a high degree of covert coordination and a consensus that aligns with a negative perception of the governance of one’s own country. Further, this is all within a robust system with a set chain of command. It does not appear feasible that plans to execute a military coup are not thwarted at its early origins. Thus, a future military structuring–a shadow of its former self–defined by a loose chain of leadership and corruption, opens the possibility for a military-coup. In this scenario, the future military budget may comprise a small fraction of what it is currently; poor military funding can contribute towards a less rigid and maintained system.  </p>
		<p>Another possibility, assuming a future U.S. military retains its chain of command, is the ratification of an internal executive order that commands the military to overthrow the pre-existing government. This would require a dystopic scenario to occur, severely hindering governmental processes from being performed and an incapacity for the government to preserve a semblance of peace and order. </p>
